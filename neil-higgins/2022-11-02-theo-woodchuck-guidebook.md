## Junior Woodchucks' Guidebook

The Junior Woodchucks' Guidebook is an imaginary book that contains the information you need to know in order to accomplish whatever you need to get done next.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Woodchucks

Of course, every EverEverLander was a Junior Woodchuck and can lay their hands on their well-worn copy.

;-)

Below, are some things in today's book.

## Dates

Always year-month-day with hyphens

Why

* Sort nicely when part of a tilew that needs sorting in numerical order
* Gets around  ~ US and international month-day-year / day month-year difference

## Emails

* Start new topics frequently
* Long threads become confusing
* Short threads can be "closed"
* Long threads just become longer


## File Names

Use date-author-topic


## File Format: Markdown

* https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ ~ where it all started
>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

* http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
>PHILOSOPHY
>Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
>
>Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters — including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText — the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
>Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.[9] Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

## Fonts

The font used here is the the default 'monospace' font as determined by your browser. This is because it is the most common font used to write scripts.
